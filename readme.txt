--Readme document for Katrina Mizuo --

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

10/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
    - At least one image, with descriptive alt attribute(s)
    - Links to external page(s)
    - Multiple pages, with appropriate navigation between them
    - Adding custom icons from Google Material Icons, Font Awesome, or similar


(b) CSS features
    - Modifying link, text color, or other colors to be visually appealing, perhaps with one of the pallette creators in the resources tab
    - Leveraging Bootstrap CSS helpers such as image shapes and table layouts to display content in a more interesting manner


(c) Advanced features
    - Creating a more complex page layout, such as including a sidebar or navigation bar
    - A contact form which leverages HTML forms


3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
    I would say I spent around 10-15 hours on this assignment across several days (I first started looking at this when it was posted during break and worked on it when the quarter began).


4. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)
    - A portfolio I made for a previous class (https://kmizuo-portfolio.webflow.io/)
    - "Submit HTML form to Google Form" (https://mrinalcs.github.io/submit-html-form-to-google-form)
    - Bootstrap documentation (https://getbootstrap.com/docs)
    - Submitting an HTML form using ajax to prevent page redirection (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60446868/submit-a-html-form-without-redirection-and-showing-a-success-message)
    - Adding jQuery to web pages (https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_get_started.asp)
    - Prevent script from redirecting page after form submission (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72131242/how-to-prevent-google-app-script-reloading-redirecting-my-webpage-after-form-dat)
    - Album example from Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/album/)

5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
    I didn't really talk to anyone else for this assignment.


6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
    Nothing extra to run the code, but feel free to visit the site at https://uci-inf-133.github.io/a1-portfolio-kmizuo/ (you can also leave some origami suggestions for me on the contact page =) ).
